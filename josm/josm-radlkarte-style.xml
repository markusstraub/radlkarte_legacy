A little help:
1. every rule starts with <rule> and ends with </rule>
2. every rule needs a condition
	-k for the key (required)
	-v for the value as a string
	-b for the values yes / no (boolean, will also understand true, 1 and false, 0 respectively)
	Both -v and -b are optional (but recommended). If both are ommitted, the rule will apply to all
	tags with the given key - don't forget to set a priority if other rules could also apply.
3. line attributes
	- width absolute width in pixel in every zoom level
	- realwidth relative width which will be scaled in meters, integer
	- colour
	- priority
	- dashed x - dashed line, length of dashes / spaces in x pixels
	- dashed x,y - dashed line, x length of dashes / spaces in y pixels
	- dashedcolour second (background) colour of a dashed line
4. linemod attributes
	- all line attributes
	- mode ('over' or 'under')
	- width can be specified relative to modified way:
	  +x - <x> pixels are added to way size
	  -x - <x> pixels are subtracted from way size
	  x% - the size is <x> percent of modified way
	  If the size is <= 1 the minimum size of 1 is used.
5. area attributes
	- colour
	- priority
	- closed (true or false - when true the area style is ignored for unclosed ways)
6. icon attributes
	- icon (path to icon)
	  - relative to the icon path
	  - URL's are also supported to allow remote icons (are cached locally)
	- priority
	- annonate (true or false)
7. scale_min / scale_max
	- zoom scale for display (currently unused)

Using both area and line attributes for the same key/value pair does work. For areas
first the best matching area rule is searched and the best matching line rule is
connected with it. They need not have the same key/value pair.

The colours can consist of the two components - name and hex code (e.g. water#0000ff).
If both are given, the color name is introduced in preferences with that value. If only
code is given (e.g. #0000ff), it is used directly. If only name is given, either user
modified preferences or previous value is used. The 6 hex digit color code can also
be appended by a hex value of the alpha channel (thus having 8 hex digits instead of 6).

Linemod's are drawn over or under the line they are associated with and modify the
appearance. There can be multiple linemod's for one way (contrary to line styles,
where only one applies). When drawn over a way either a very small width must be choosen
or an alpha value must be used for the colour field (otherwise the original way is
not visible). When the mod is under the way, then it must be wide enough to be visible
on the sides of the way or the waystyles itself must use alpha channel (which may
look strange).

If a key/value pair matches more than one rule, the "rule that wins" is unpredicted
in case they have same priority! Using priority settings helps to solve conflicts.

For external files the <rules> should have following elements:
- author           the author of the style
- version          a version number of some sort (e.g. creation date)
- description      what is your style meant to be
- shortdescription very short description
- link              a link to a helpful website (optional)
- name             is the name of the style
- icon             icon to display in style choosing dialog
- The fields description, shortdescription and link may also be localized (e.g. de.link)
